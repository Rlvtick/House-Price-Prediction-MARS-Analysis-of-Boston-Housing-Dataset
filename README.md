In this project, I applied Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a non-parametric regression technique, to analyze and predict median house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The objective was to develop a predictive model capable of capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, which traditional linear regression methods often fail to address. By focusing on key predictors such as the average number of rooms, socioeconomic factors, and student-teacher ratios, the study aimed to deliver accurate and interpretable insights for real estate pricing dynamics while ensuring a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy.
